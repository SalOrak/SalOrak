## Praise the Sun ☀️

Hello there, I'm Hector Alarcon, also known as *SalORak* (🐍)

I'm a systems engineer with a passion for OS development and embedded systems. 

My main languages as of right now are: C, Rust, Lua, Python and NodeJS.

I use Neovim as my main editor and I've developed some plugins over the years. Check them out:

- [Whaler.nvim](https://github.com/salorak/whaler.nvim): A minimalist project manager to work around files and directories inside Neovim editor using Telescope. (Lua)

- [Ansible-doc.nvim](https://github.com/salorak/ansible-doc.nvim): A Neovim plugin to search ansible documentation inside Neovim. It uses `fzf-lua` to fuzzy find ansible module documentations. (Lua)
- [libtmux.nvim](https://github.com/salorak/libtmux.nvim): A thin wrapper to interact with the complete Tmux api from Neovim. (Lua)



If you are curious about my system, I currently use NixOS as my daily-driver. The configuration is based on flakes: [NixOS Configuration](https://github.com/salorak/snakes).

And my [config files](https://github.com/salorak/dotfiles) for the tools I use.
